# Olin Performance Improv Und Magick
*Last modified Aug 23 2016*

## Purpose

To learn and practice long-form imrpov comedy; to do improv performances at Olin; to travel to improv jams with other college troupes, compete, and seek out coaching and demonstrations from professional comedians

## Membership

Auditions are held at the beginning of each academic year and somewhere from 6-10 troupe members are chosen. Troupe members commit to two 1.5-hour practices per week and a 1-hour bonding block per week. OPIUM members also commit to putting on a 1-hour show at the end of every month.

## Officers and Roles

OPIUM has two co-leaders who run practice, investigate opportunities and organize logistics for travel/growth, and plan/advertise shows.

## Transition Protocol

If one of the two co-leaders is graduating, the troupe votes in April for a replacement. The younger of the co-leaders traditionally leads most practices and steps up organizationally under the guidance of the elder co-leader so that they can learn the ropes.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

The club needs no materials, but will request funding for an Improv Boston college membership and admission to College Comedy Fest in the spring.

## Events and Activities

Shows, workshops, hosting other improv troupes, traveling to jam with other improv troupes, going into Boston to watch adults do improv

## Amendment Procedure

Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time by any member. We will talk it over and get communal agreement on a change; if there is division, we'll take a vote and pass the amendment if there's greater than 50% approval.
